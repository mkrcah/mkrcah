<h1>Resist the quench for coding.
</h1>
<article>
    <p>We, software engineers, love to build.</p>
<p>The thrilling sensation of adding a feature or creating something new from scratch. The excitement of using the latest technology that we've been reading about on Hacker News for so long.</p>
<p>And thus, we build.</p>
<p>We dive into coding, into architecture, into design. Quenching another dose of the thrill.</p>
<p>I am guilty of this.</p>
<p>Yet, I came to believe that blindly following the thirst is by far the largest productivity killer. I believe that coding should be considered the very last resort, used only when all other options are exhausted.</p>
<p>Let me explain.</p>
<p>Development is very expensive. It takes long to finish. It requires future time investment. It requires maintenance and bug fixes. There is opportunity cost. And there is a possibility that our work won't be used in production, because the priorities have shifted.</p>
<p>No matter the team, the agile process or the technology stack, the development will always be this way - resource intensive. Coding slows down the company, drains the IT budget and creates technical debt for future.</p>
<p>So before blindly jumping into coding, take a step back. Understand arguments why the problem or the feature at hand needs to be build in the first place. Find if there is a way to simplify the problem. Find if there is an existing solution in-house or off-the-shelf that can be reused to solve it.</p>
<p>Fight that internal thirst as much as possible.</p>
<p>Only as the very last resort, only when all other options fail, start thinking about the very minimal coding solution to the problem you have.</p>
<p>And, very cautiously, take that first sip.</p>
