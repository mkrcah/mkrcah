<h1>How To Rapidly Transition Your Career To Big Data
</h1>
<p class="date">October 2016 </p>
<article>
    <p>You have decided to do a career switch to THE BIG DATA, but you don't know how.</p>
<p>Here's what to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose your role</li>
<li>Build a sexy demo and job hunt guerilla-style</li>
</ol>
<h2>Step One: Choose your role</h2>
<p>There are four roles in this big-data world:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finding insights in the past</li>
<li>Setting up &amp; delivering a data warehouse</li>
<li>Predicting future from past data</li>
<li>Coding data-driven product features</li>
</ul>
<h3>Role 1: Finding insights in the past</h3>
<p>This is a key role in jobs titled Data analyst and Marketing analyst. Also, it's a key prerequisite for Growth Hackers.</p>
<p>You answer questions about the past to help steer the business forward. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>How does the <a href="http://cohortanalysis.com/">cohorts</a> look like in our customer base?</li>
<li>Which airport gates lead to the most late passangers?</li>
<li>Which customer micro-segment is driving the most revenue?</li>
</ul>
<p>You use BI tools (like Tableau, Looker) to interactively explore and visualize data. If you are more technical, you reach for SQL and/or R.</p>
<p>After a while, you start impacting metrics that you report. You use <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/the-definitive-guide-to-growth-hacking">growth hacking</a> and <a href="https://www.optimizely.com/ab-testing/">A/B testing</a>. And you provably improve company's profit.</p>
<p>Learn the first steps by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the first 50-pages of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pyramid-Principle-Logic-Writing-Thinking/dp/0273710516">Pyramid principle</a> to get yourself acquainted with top-down reasoning</li>
<li>Search for online-sources for Data Analysis (example: <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/subject/data-analysis-statistics">edX</a>, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/courses?languages=en&amp;query=data+analysis">Coursera</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Role 2: Setting up &amp; delivering a data warehouse</h3>
<p>This is a key role in jobs titled Data Engineer, ETL engineer and Hadoop developer.</p>
<p>Typically, your responsiblity is to combine multiple company data  together from various sources.</p>
<p>For example, you combine customer data from Salesforce, support data from Intercom, product usage from a few production Postgres databases, real-time customer events from Kafka and you sprinkle it with historical weather information.</p>
<p>Then you create an abstraction on top of this data to provide a single source of truth. You operate between two departments:</p>
<ul>
<li>the business:  to align on metric definitions and</li>
<li>the IT: to get the integrations right.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having all data together in this manner has HUGE benefits - all of a sudden, the time-to-answer drops from days/weeks to zero. Connect a self-service BI tool on top of it (e.g <a href="https://looker.com/">Looker</a>, <a href="http://www.metabase.com/">Metabase</a>) and you are there.</p>
<p>Note that there are cloud solutions out there which provide the warehousing and data shoveling for you. Checkout <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/?hp=tile&amp;so-exp=below">Redshift</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/">BigQuery</a> for warehousing and <a href="https://www.alooma.com/">Alooma</a>, <a href="https://www.stitchdata.com/">Stitch</a> and <a href="https://www.fivetran.com/">Fivetran</a> for shoveling.</p>
<p>You need to do the data merging yourself - that's the company domain. You do this either with SQL or a data processing tool:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn SQL <a href="https://community.modeanalytics.com/sql/tutorial/introduction-to-sql/">here</a>, especially the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12552288/sql-with-clause-example">cool</a> <a href="https://community.modeanalytics.com/sql/tutorial/sql-window-functions/">features</a></li>
<li>Learn <a href="http://spark.apache.org/">Spark</a>, it's sexy these days. Learn it <a href="https://youtu.be/fn3WeMZZcCk?t=878">here</a> and <a href="https://databricks.com/training">here</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Software engineering skills are expected. Learn principles of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670/ref=pd_sbs_14_t_1?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=3RJ1DN7QVHCWJEKCBDGT">clean-coding</a> and learn Python or Scala.</li>
<li>Scala is hot. Get the certificate from <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1">this legendary course</a> and put it on your LinkedIn.</li>
<li>You <em>don't</em> need to learn Hadoop. Most companies <a href="https://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2013/hadoop_hatred.html">don't need Hadoop</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Role 3: Predicting future from past data</h3>
<p>This is a key role in jobs titled Data Scientist and Quants.</p>
<p>Your role is to predict behavior by learning from the past data:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the products that customer X is most interested in?</li>
<li>How much is product X going to be traded on the exchange tomorrow?</li>
<li>How to optimally coordinate airplane routes to minimize fuel costs?</li>
<li>How utilized will the Tesla super-chargers be tomorrow at location X?</li>
</ul>
<p>You are the math guy in the company. You know machine-learning, simulations or numerical computing. Typically, machine-learning is required. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>supervised/unsupervised machine-learning models</li>
<li>ability to prevent over-fitting</li>
<li>ability to engineer and select the right features</li>
</ul>
<p>Daily bread is Pandas, Scikit-learn (my favourite), Matlab, R or SparkML. However, I know a guy in Booking.com who uses C++ for his machine-learning experiments.  </p>
<p>Learn the first steps by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow the legendary <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Andrew Ng's lecture</a> on machine-learning</li>
<li>Go to <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions">Kaggle</a> to practice your skills.</li>
<li>The Kaggle <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/forums">forums</a> are legendary, you will learn a LOT of practical info there</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus is on understanding the business and the underlying data so you can come up with the right data <a href="http://machinelearningmastery.com/discover-feature-engineering-how-to-engineer-features-and-how-to-get-good-at-it/">features</a>.</li>
<li>Once the features are there, a simple model would do.</li>
<li>Less software engineering skills is expected. Clean-code is not a priority. There is another role for translation the model into production.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Role 4: Developing data-driven product features</h3>
<p>This is a common role in jobs titled Data Engineer.</p>
<p>You are putting into production features driven by prediction and machine-learning models:</p>
<ul>
<li>compute product recommendations and expose them via API, which is consumed by team-members building the mobile app</li>
<li>implement a stock prediction algorithm within a production trading platform</li>
</ul>
<p>If there is a dedicated data scientist, you work closely with him/her to translate their model to production code. If there is a growth-hacker, you work closely to implement their ideas.</p>
<ul>
<li>You are a software engineer by heart: you know a few languages, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it">YAGNI</a>, clean-code, continuous delivery, unit/functional tests, monitoring - the whole shebang.</li>
<li>On top of it, you understand the big-data ecosystem used by the team (e.g. Kafka, Spark, <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-elasticsearch-logstash-and-kibana-elk-stack-on-ubuntu-14-04">ELK Stack</a>)</li>
<li>On top of it, you understand machine-learning and can translate data scientists model into production.</li>
<li>Sometimes, data scientists are also engineers who put their models into production</li>
</ul>
<p>Learn the first steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are not a coder, get an engineering job first. I recommend Scala. Try to grasp the functional approach of it. Scala is used heavily in big-data community. Another option would be Python. Once you are good in engineering, go to the next step:</li>
<li>If you are a coder, learn Spark and a few other technologies. It's the tech-stack you know that will get you this role.</li>
<li>Although companies think they need Hadoop, they <a href="(https://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2013/hadoop_hatred.html)">most probably don't</a>. But it's good to learn it, so you understand situations when Hadoop is useful. Checkout the major Hadoop distributions (e.g. <a href="www.cloudera.com">Cloudera</a>, <a href="http://hortonworks.com/">Hortonworks</a>, <a href="http://www.mapr.com">MapR</a>), install it locally and try to get the basic ETL up and running. Or checkout cloud solutions like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/emr/">AWS EMR</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/">Google Dataproc</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Choose your role by your current strengths:</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you have an economic background and no engineering skills yet, go for Data Analyst.</li>
<li>If you have system administration background, go for setting up a warehouse.</li>
<li>If you have software engineering background, go for data engineering.</li>
<li>If you have strong mathematical, model, statistics background, go for Data Scientist.</li>
<li>If you are a student, go learn machine-learning, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670/ref=pd_sbs_14_t_1?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=3RJ1DN7QVHCWJEKCBDGT">clean coding</a>, Scala and Clojure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't worry too much with the initial choice. Especially in smaller companies, the roles overlap and you have freedom to move between the roles. I know a Data Scientist doing warehousing stuff for two years and a Data Engineer doing growth hacking.</p>
<p>Still not sure which role? <a href="mailto://m@marcel.is?subject=Which role to choose">Drop me</a> an email.</p>
<h2>Step 2: Build a sexy demo and go guerilla</h2>
<p>Do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read <a href="https://medium.com/the-mission/how-to-get-any-job-you-want-even-if-you-re-unqualified-6f49a65f5491#.c1cuqxawh">this article</a> and <a href="http://brohrer.github.io/get_data_science_job.html">this article</a> and choose one of these two approaches.</li>
<li>Choose your target company.</li>
<li>Build a (targeted) demo</li>
</ul>
<p>For choosing the target company:</p>
<ul>
<li>aim for a smaller one, ideally a startup. There is much more freedom to experiment and switch roles.</li>
<li>aim for a team where only 1-2 people do what you do. This gives you a lot of space to experiment. Plus the opportunity of taking up the full responsibility once they decide to move to something else.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the demo, here are a few examples:</p>
<h4>Example 1 (for data analysts): Data insights and recommended next-steps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Find interesting data about the company you are hunting, e.g. <a href="https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets">in this collection on GitHub</a>.</li>
<li>Get Excel, <a href="https://public.tableau.com/s/">Tableau Public</a> or a similar tool and dive deep into data</li>
<li>Deliver a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pyramid-Principle-Logic-Writing-Thinking/dp/0273710516/ref=pd_sbs_14_img_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=KBBSY0YBQYA53CZEREKJ">top-down</a> structured research story with recommendations on next steps</li>
</ul>
<h4>Example 2 (for data analysts): Tailored growth-hacking recommendations</h4>
<ul>
<li>Read more about <a href="https://github.com/btomashvili/awesome-growth-hacking">growth-hacking</a> and <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/book">lean startup</a></li>
<li>Guess problems the target company is facing by studying their products</li>
<li>Deliver a list of 5-10 actions you would advise them and metrics on how to evaluate progress</li>
</ul>
<h4>Example 3: (for data engineers): Spark Streaming with real-time visualizations</h4>
<ul>
<li>Spark is hot, <a href="http://spark.apache.org/streaming/">Spark Streaming</a> especially.</li>
<li>Play with combination of Twitter and Spark Streaming, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn3WeMZZcCk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1038">here</a></li>
<li>Or play locally on your computer, example <a href="https://github.com/mkrcah/scala-kafka-twitter">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Example 4: (for data engineers): Click-stream processing with Kafka &amp; Alooma</h4>
<ul>
<li>Build a <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org">simple web app</a>, collect clicks via <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Kafka</a></li>
<li>From Kafka, send the clicks to <a href="https://www.alooma.com/">Alooma</a>. Sessionize the clicks in Alooma and pipe it to <a href="https://bigquery.cloud.google.com">BigQuery</a>.</li>
<li>Connect <a href="metabase.com">Metabase</a> to BigQuery to show reports on basic usage</li>
<li>You have just build a simple version of Google Analytics!</li>
<li>Bonus: Find which SaaS product your target company is using (e.g. for customer support) and merge that data with the clickstream.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Example 5: (for data scientists): Open-source your Kaggle solution</h4>
<ul>
<li>Compete on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions">Kaggle</a></li>
<li>Once you have a decent model, put it on Github and LinkedIn and blog about it.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Example 6: (for data scientists): Deliver tailored prediction</h4>
<ul>
<li>Get hold of data which might be interesting for your target company, for example <a href="https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets">here</a></li>
<li>Find a problem which can be framed as a machine-learning problem.</li>
<li>Solve it, package the result in a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pyramid-Principle-Logic-Writing-Thinking/dp/0273710516/ref=pd_sbs_14_img_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=KBBSY0YBQYA53CZEREKJ">top-down story</a> in a <a href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> notebook and <a href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/">share it only</a>. Put it on Linked and blog and it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>FAQ:</h2>
<h4>Shall I do pro-bono?</h4>
<p>Sure. If you don't feel confident about your current skills, do a pro-bono project.
Reach to your network of friends, family and colleagues. Try to get a contact
within your network that would tell you about their company problems and are willing
to share their data. In exchange for your work (if done well), you'd ask for a referral that you can post on your LinkedIn/blog.</p>
